             What solution can our design provide?

          </p>
          <p>
              
Our design makes this process easy to maintain by gathering all the F&B item details you offer, in a library, so that you can instantly add them while creating an event or a package. 

          </p>
          <p >
Our designs also provide you with customizable templates for creating a new F&B package from scratch with existing items (or new items) according to your customer needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            
	We understand that order documents are the key to communication between the hospitality staff and kitchen staff. Thus our F&B software system syncs packages and quantities you have added to orders into your Banquet Event Order (BEOs), to keep them updated all the time.
<p class="font-weight-bold">
Future Scope</p>
<p>
    After creating F&B packages for events, you can simply add the pricing and quantity of each unit in the package. That will allow you to create single-click F&B proposals and invoices to simplify your sales and billings.
